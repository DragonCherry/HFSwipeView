# This repository won't updated anymore. Due to structural problem(not based on auto layout & unstable when orientation change), I'm not recommend this source to use for infinite cells. Maybe I'll create a new, better and cleaner solution for solving complex infinite cell problems but not here!

A swipe view loops through multiple view items infinitely, with UIPageControl attached. It's very similar to ViewPager from android but it also supports circulation between multiple views. In circulating mode(infinite loop), it will automatically locates current view at the center of swipe view.

Any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

## Features

- supports circulating mode(inifinite loop)

- supports auto-align selected cell on center of the view

- supports auto-slide(in circulating mode only) based on given NSTimeInterval, you can use it like banner-style view.

- supports magnifying mode(magnifies selected-center cell)

- supports auto shrinking UIPageControl at the bottom area of the HFSwipeView
